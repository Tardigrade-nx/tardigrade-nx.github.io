      <description>Game Of Life Kusushi Game of Life Kuzushi is a homebrew game for Game Boy, that mixes Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life, with a block breaker game.
Unlike in regular block breaker games, here cells evolve periodically, following Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life rules:
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. Any live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors dies.</description>

      <description>Logic Island Logic Island is my first homebrew game for the original Game Boy, yay!
Download : https://tardigrade-nx.itch.io/logic-island Logic Island a Picross-like logic puzzle game for the original Game Boy, inspired by Nikoli&amp;rsquo;s Nurikabe. Nurikabe is one of my favorite games of all times. This is my version of it, with graphics hopefully a little more elaborate than a simple grid.
The rules may not be as simple as Picross at first, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it: once you know how to play, the game becomes very addictive, with a lot of depth and strategies to offer.</description>
