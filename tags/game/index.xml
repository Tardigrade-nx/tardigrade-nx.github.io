      <description>Logic Island Logic Island is my first homebrew game for the original Game Boy, yay!
 Download : https://tardigrade-nx.itch.io/logic-island  Logic Island a Picross-like logic puzzle game for the original Game Boy, inspired by Nikoli&amp;rsquo;s Nurikabe. Nurikabe is one of my favorite games of all times. This is my version of it, with graphics hopefully a little more elaborate than a simple grid.
The rules may not be as simple as Picross at first, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it: once you know how to play, the game becomes very addictive, with a lot of depth and strategies to offer.</description>

      <description>SlitherlinkNX Slitherlink is a logic puzzle game created in 1989 by Japanese publisher Nikoli, famous for creating Sudoku, among many other puzzle games. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink for more info.
I discovered the game a few years ago on the Nintendo DS with &amp;lsquo;Puzzle Series Vol. 5: Slitherlink&amp;rsquo;, which was never released outside of Japan. It&amp;rsquo;s such a good game I grew addicted to it, just like with Picross and Nurikabe.
This is my version of the game for the Nintendo Switch.</description>

      <description>Game&amp;amp;Watch Fantasies A homebrew game for PSP.
Download: GWF.zip / GWFv2.zip
Source: GWFv2_src.zip
Game&amp;amp;Watch Fantasies is a puzzle/platform game for the PSP, inspired by the Game&amp;amp;Watch LCD games.
 Rule #1: Just like in a Game&amp;amp;Watch, the hero moves discontinuously. Therefore, he can &amp;ldquo;teleport&amp;rdquo; through thin obstacles by simply walking or jumping. However, gravity doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow him to do so: it is impossible to go through an obstacle when falling.   Rule #2: If the obstacle is too large, the hero will move until he touches it.</description>
