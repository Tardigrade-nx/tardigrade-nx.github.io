      <description>The Pawn The Pawn is an original puzzle game for Android, inspired by chess. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to know the rules of Chess to play, as it is quite different.
 Tap to move, one square at a time. Move onto another friend piece to change into it. Change into the king to win. Move onto an enemy piece to knock it out. Each piece has a different move set, indicated by arrows.</description>

      <title>[Nintendo Switch] SlitherlinkNX</title>

      <description>SlitherlinkNX Slitherlink is a logic puzzle game created in 1989 by Japanese publisher Nikoli, famous for creating Sudoku, among many other puzzle games. See (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink) for more info.
I discovered the game a few years ago on the Nintendo DS with &amp;lsquo;Puzzle Series Vol. 5: Slitherlink&amp;rsquo;, which was never released outside of Japan. It&amp;rsquo;s such a good game I became addicted to it, just like with Picross and Nurikabe.
This is my version of the game for the Nintendo Switch.</description>
